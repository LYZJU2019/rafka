# Infrastructure Management Responsibilities

## Core Tasks

### 1. **Cluster Setup**
- Set up Kubernetes clusters or similar orchestration tools.
- Ensure high availability (HA) and fault tolerance.

### 2. **Database Management**
- Configure database clustering, replication, and backups.
- Support sharding and partitioning for scalability.

### 3. **Load Balancing**
- Set up load balancers for traffic distribution.
- Implement failover and rate limiting.

### 4. **Monitoring and Alerts**
- Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana for system health monitoring.
- Set up logging and critical alerts for rapid issue resolution.

### 5. **Scaling**
- Enable auto-scaling for dynamic resource adjustments.
- Optimize resource usage to balance cost and performance.

### 6. **Security**
- Implement network firewalls and role-based access controls (RBAC).
- Ensure secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS, SSH) and regular updates.

### 7. **Disaster Recovery**
- Create recovery plans for failures or disasters.
- Set up and test backups for databases and services.

### 8. **Networking**
- Configure private/public networks and manage connectivity.
- Implement service meshes (e.g., Istio) for secure and efficient communication.

### 9. **Cost Management**
- Monitor and optimize cloud usage costs.
- Scale down or terminate underutilized resources.

### 10. **Documentation**
- Maintain detailed setup, troubleshooting, and scaling guides.
- Create incident response procedures for infrastructure issues.

### Stretch Goals
- **Multi-region Deployment** for global availability.
- **Serverless Options** for reduced operational overhead.
- **Infrastructure as Code** with tools like Terraform or CloudFormation.
